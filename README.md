## Configuration

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured in the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can customize the theme, add plugins, and modify the configuration according to your needs.

### Ant Design

Ant Design components are ready to use throughout the application. You can customize the theme and components in your project configuration.
